# Cryptozon 
Live demo: https://www.cryptozon.app/post

Cryptozon is an NFT marketplace with social media features. Users are able to share posts, like and comment on other posts, follow users, customize their own profiles, as well as buy and sell NFTs. This application was built in less than three weeks with a team of four during the Fullstack Academy 2202 cohort. 

## General Information
